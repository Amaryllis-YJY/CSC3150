**_Note 1_**: For Assignment 1 and 2, I gave up the bonus part (10 points)

**_Note 2_**: Assignment 3 and 4 are based on (or completely the same as) the MIT course on Operating System. To run them you should download the corresponding templates of xv6 system and substitute the files with same names of the original kernel

**_Note 3_**: When I was submitting Assignment 3, I accidentally submitted an empty zip file. It was not until the release of the grades that I knew the mistake I made. Thus, 50 points are reduced for a penalty (which means I was supposed to get the full mark of this assignment).
